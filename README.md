# gulp-build

Gulp 3 plugin for building out files for deployment. Good for swapping environmental variables like Google Analytics IDs, or just compiling static HTML files.

`gulp-build` uses HandleBars for templates, and supports helpers, partials, and layouts.

**Version `0.5.0` was a big update. I moved away from using Underscore templates, and have added support for partials and layouts. Both partials and layouts must be passed in as strings, but a future update will bring support for file glob'ing.**

## Install

```shell
npm install --save-dev gulp-build
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```javascript
var build = require('gulp-build');

gulp.task('build', function() {
  gulp.src('scripts/*.js')
      .pipe(build({ GA_ID: '123456' }))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});
```

With helpers:

```javascript
var build = require('gulp-build');

var options = {
  helpers: [{
    name: 'addition',
    fn: function(a, b) { return a + b; }
  }]
};

gulp.task('build', function() {
  gulp.src('pages/*.html')
      .pipe(build({ title: 'Some page' }, options))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});

```

Helpers are regular Handlebars helpers or block helpers that your layout, partials, and templates can call.

For more information on Handlebars helpers, see http://handlebarsjs.com/#helpers and http://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html.

With partials and a layout:

```javascript
var build = require('gulp-build');

var options = {
	partials: [{
		name: 'footer',
		tpl: '<p>Copyright 2013</p>'
	}],
	layout: '<html><body>{{> body}}</body></html>'
};

gulp.task('build', function() {
  gulp.src('pages/*.html')
      .pipe(build({ title: 'Some page' }, options))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});

```

If your templates want to render partials, you just reference them as: `{{> partialName}}`.

If you use a layout, you need the `{{> body}}` tag for the plugin to know where to place your content. If you omit it, your compiled file will be missing the main content!

## API

### gulp-build(data, config)

#### data
Templates vars passed down to `HandleBars` for compiling

#### config.layout
Type: `String`<br />
Default: null

#### config.partials
Type: `Array` containing `Objects`<br />
Default: []

A config object with partials would look like:

```javascript
var options = {
  partials: [
    { name: 'footer', tpl: '<p>Copyright 2014</p>' },
    { name: 'header', tpl: '<h1>The Header!</h1>' }
  ]
};
```

Your template could use those partials by using: `{{> footer}}` or `{{> header}}`

### gulp-build.hbs

Access to handlebars instance to extend its own functional.

## Contributing

I'd like to see other template frameworks get integrated. Frameworks like: `ejs`, `Hogan` and `Mustache` but I might not have time to get to these soon.

If you'd like to help out, just submit a pull request. Before submitting though, be sure to:

* Update the README
* Write new tests
* Ensure previous tests don't break
* Ensure `jshint` doesn't fail
* Follow code layout/style

You can run tests and `jshint` with:

```shell
gulp lint
gulp test
```

The default `gulp` task will run both of those.

## Testing

Open a terminal in the directory containing `gulp-build` and then:

```shell
npm install
gulp
```
